This is a website to create ships in the RPG "Stars Without Number".

## Before you judge the source code

The biggest reason I wrote this was to learn more React and Redux stuff. There's a lot I'd do differently if I started over. The styling isn't great, both of the code and the page, there's a lot of code bloat, you name it. So treat this for what it is: a pet project of a 2nd year uni student who's mostly moved on to bigger things.

## Development

It was built with `create-react-app`, so run it with `yarn start` or `npm start`.
